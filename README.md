# Discord.js-Commands
Here are commands that you can copy paste into your bot! (Must have switch args in otherwise there would be a few errors)

There are a few commands you need but I will be adding files that you can just use for a basic discord bot using Discord.js!

If you need any help with something, DM me on twitter here "https://twitter.com/alexthefembot"
Or Discord at "Alex the FemBot#3667"
