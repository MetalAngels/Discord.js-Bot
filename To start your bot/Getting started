To get started, first go to https://discord.com/developers/applications

Now once you've logged in, click on "New Application" on the top right and set a name for your bot

It'll redirect you to the settings of the bot so now go to "Bot" in the settings category in the left and press "Add Bot"

It will now make your bot!

Right under the name, you'll see "Token" and a click to reveal line. That is where the token you need to get the bot to login.

You also need to invite the bot to your discord server so go to https://discordapi.com/permissions.html

Get the client ID from General Information under the name there and set what permissions you want the bot to have when inviting the bot to your server to have.
